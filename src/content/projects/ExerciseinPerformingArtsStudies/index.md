_Exercise in Performing Arts Studies_ is an autobiographical documentary performance as a self-reflexive critique that overviews the historical conditions and present situations of our being here, based on the reflection upon our place as something temporary and arbitrary. Students majoring performing arts studies set questions of what performing arts studies are, why we study them, what meaning they have, and why it is so difficult and complicated to explain and prove these questions. They perform the process of setting these questions and tracking the answers through the frame of ‘performance’, their object of study.
