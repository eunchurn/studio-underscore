**underscore** is a team of two, Inkyung Baik and Hakyung Sim.

Inkyung, a visual design major, and Hakyung, an English literature major, met at the Interdisciplinary Program of Performing Arts Studies at Seoul National University. They have studied and worked together since, and are thinking the contemporary from a performing arts perspective as _underscore_ since 2017.

**underscore** does the following:

"underscore" : We set problems through reading and underscoring, and carry out research upon those problems.

"\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" : We connect the conceptual to the sensible.

"\_\_\_\_\_\_score" : We deal with scores as what enable future performances as aesthetic forms.

"(working) under (the) score" : We carry out performances following the scores.
